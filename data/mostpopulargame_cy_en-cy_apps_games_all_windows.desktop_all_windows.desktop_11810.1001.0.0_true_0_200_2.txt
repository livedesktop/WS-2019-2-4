Yes, off course, it gives us second chances, but it will be better if you don't put yourself in cases to look for a second chance, but actually, use the moments and celebrate life.\r\n\r\nIt is in human nature to look for new moments, new challenges. You can live in one town than another, in one country than another. The worst thing is to get used to one thing.\r\n\r\nOur heroes of the game decided to give chance to a farmers' life. Deborah, Gary and Amy are new farmers who arrive at Jack's Farm. They should begin with their farmer stuff, but experience and help are the things that they need very necessarily. Our player is here to help around with the everyday obligations on the farm.\r\nSame games: Pearl Peril, Ghost Train, Emily Vacation, Neighborhood Garage Sale","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NHKMHHCL9X2","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Drag Racing Nitro","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24558.13628468541636105.ca769cf3-178d-46c7-9159-356bd42d8fa1.73e443e0-1f27-422f-a3bf-fda2c6600f41","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2939.13628468541636105.05994bdd-a70e-47aa-b307-f1e171e7e95a.b6c9d4d5-914b-426c-a753-9a8fbf1cd6d9","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24558.13628468541636105.ca769cf3-178d-46c7-9159-356bd42d8fa1.73e443e0-1f27-422f-a3bf-fda2c6600f41","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["59192DragonPokeGames.DragRacingNitro_dqa1dx3zdn60e"],"ContentIds":["57f53468-8a0f-58a6-fdd6-6c7a6a0328f6","c7dcf381-f898-bdda-e12d-ba634f9f0685"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you like drag racing games?

Make use of terrain covers and buildings to boost your statistics and outwit your enemies in campaign and skirmish modes.\r\nTake part in four exciting campaigns, control heroes with unique combat abilities, protect your people and encounter powerful enemies. Command units such as; Infantry, Cavalry, Mages, powerful siege machines, Elven archers, Dwarven riflemen, and many, many more.\r\nIn the Human campaign you assume the role of Percival Kent, an experienced paladin who has been sent by the Emperor to investigate reports of Goblin activity in a Human settlement. The kingdom is at the brink of war… Who wants it to break out? What kind of alliance will you have to forge to face the inevitable invasion of the green-skinned foes?\r\nThe Elven campaign introduces Arcaena, leader of the Elven archers. While you are trying to find Sylvius – a wise druid who can tame the forces of nature, you’ll face a powerful goblin mage and his allies.\r\nIn the Orcs and Goblins campaign you can even control a mighty dragon and his sneaky goblin friend Vulpis who can trick his enemies and perform a deadly strikes.

It comes from the shedding family of card games.\r\nThe objective is to get rid of all the cards you have been dealt. Its quick and 'speedy' play keeps both players pleasantly on the edge. Racing to get rid of all cards first, players can finish a game within less than a few minutes. Speed and accuracy is the key.\r\n\r\nSpeed card has been a long time preferred card game to play between two players. \r\nThe rules are fairly simple and can be taught to young children who possess basic math skills.\r\nEach player is dealt five cards to form a hand, and 15 cards face down to form a draw pile. Two stacks of five cards, placed face down on each side between the players, serve as replacement piles. \r\nTwo cards are placed face up in the center between the replacement piles. Using cards from their hand, the players must simultaneously place cards one above or one below on top of the center stacks. For example, a pile with a six on top may have a five or a seven placed on. As there is no concept of turns, one can drop multiple cards simultaneously. Jokers are used as wild cards. \r\n\r\nAce is both a high and low card, considered one value above a King as well as one below a two, so that the cards form a looping sequence. Players will always have five cards. Whenever the number of cards in a player's hands drops below five, cards are dealt to the player to make them five cards, until that player's draw pile is empty. \r\n\r\nWhen both players run out of options for play automatically card flip from the side piles onto the top of the central stacks. If these piles become depleted, the central stacks are shuffled individually and are placed face-down as new side piles from which cards can be flipped.\r\n\r\nForget taking turns! The one player who stays alert for the duration of the game has chances of winning it more in this game where fast reflexes with a cool head plays an important role.\r\nSpeed Card’s addictive nature, simple game rules, and competitive style, makes Speed Card an exciting game for two players. \r\n\r\nTry it to know whether you are as fast as you think!!\r\n\r\nDownload Speed Card today for free and you'll find an easy way to spend your time and have fun!\r\n\r\n★★★★ Speed Card Features ★★★★\r\n\r\n✓ Fast-paced game play\r\n✓ High quality graphics\r\n✓ Play Speed Card Game for FREE!\r\n✓ Rules of the game explained in great detail in the ‘Help’ section.\r\n\r\nPlease don't forget to Rate and Review Speed Card, we aim to make Speed Card one of the best card games out there on the Windows Store.\r\n\r\nEnjoy playing Speed Card!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PNW4QP5M559","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pinball Deluxe Reloaded","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55165.14340666983481644.b0ae039f-d29c-4281-a9de-505cca8588f6.73008e89-e240-4df1-ba3a-c8e569cc0963","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31633.14340666983481644.b0ae039f-d29c-4281-a9de-505cca8588f6.a20581c3-9df8-446a-be41-94403ac9d2ca","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55165.14340666983481644.b0ae039f-d29c-4281-a9de-505cca8588f6.73008e89-e240-4df1-ba3a-c8e569cc0963","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["3934LogicArcadeBattleGame.PinballDeluxeReloaded_n8gw9j5rpm0d0"],"ContentIds":["2a788d88-2e6a-e22a-c7c7-9acde8c0ed01","6d9cf985-1a4d-469f-4d5b-33b46189b229"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Pinball Deluxe Reloaded is #1 pinball game with gameplay from famous game peegle pinball!

The aim of the game is to get all of the cards in order (King to Ace). To win, you must remove all the cards from the table by building columns organized in descending order, from king to ace. At intermediate (2-suits) and advanced (4-suites) levels, the cards must also match suit. When you succeed in building a sequentially-ordered column, it flies off the table. If you run out of moves, click the pile at the bottom of the table to deal a new row of cards. \r\n\r\nIn our version we largely tried to recreate a full experience of that version in a tiny download package, along with multiple suite versions of the game, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJB4K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Taptiles","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.41137.9007199266251910.27aa9f20-490d-4306-8348-7f9c474a31d7.d6aa3072-8aaa-4d54-9160-951e754cfc45","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#9200a4","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.17931.9007199266251910.24d00971-b737-4835-b5fb-8d082e2c9188.19c44627-82ef-49d0-9d56-e378a8f67bc4","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#9200a4","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.33100.9007199266251910.012458b9-ffbf-4f61-8b31-2642293e5140.8afa9a3d-c0aa-4736-b814-d25b7e5f5fea","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#9200a4","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53920.9007199266251910.706ab283-0b9d-4c87-a2f3-1fe3a4ad8b20.b9b13592-a6d7-4a4c-a040-e567e842d265","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#9200a4","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.23372.9007199266251910.ede162da-7e95-4568-8dbd-a1a489c09482.a3598193-c1a8-4002-8242-4d656372087b","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#9200a4","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.24575.9007199266251910.1a561092-576b-494a-a7ed-dd34fd30c1e9.4d590971-89d3-4b6a-81d4-41418e907e9b","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#9200a4","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.2,"RatingsCount":"26","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.Taptiles_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["d1272621-e121-6a16-cfa1-7940021a817a"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Top 10 Free Game in the Windows Store!  \r\nFind pairs of tiles to complete puzzles in this exciting matching game with a unique twist!
